What is new in version 6?

animationEngine 6 has been optimized to work with liveCode version 6.7 and higher, including, but without warranty the current developer preview of the liveCode 8 engine (which is by the time of this writing version 8 DP 6). One of the most notably changes is one in licensing. animationEngine is now dual licensed!

Licensing terms:

These scripts are licensed to you if you agree to be bound to one of the following License types at your choice.  

1) GPL 3
You may use animationEngine as FREE Software as outlined in the terms of the GPL3 or any 
higher version of the GPL as found here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html

2) Commercial license:
If you do not want to disclose the sources of your application you have the option to purchase a commercial license
by paying a fee. You can buy a commercial license from the runrev marketplace. At the time of the writing of this document
this can be done following this link: http://livecode.com/products/extensions

You are paying a license fee for the major version of animationEngine. If you are licensing animationEngine 6.0, you will be
able to use all upgrades that carry the same major version number (in this case 6.x). Once the switch is made to a version
7.x of the library, you will need to upgrade your license to use the latest version. However, of course you may continue to use
any version of the library you currently have licensed, without needing to purchase an upgrade.

If you have previously licensed an earlier version of animationEngine, a discounted upgrade option may be available.

Such a commercial license releases you from the requirements of the copyleft GPL license, which include: distribution of all 
source code, including your own product; licensing of your own product under the GPL license; prominent mention of the 
derbrill copyright and the GPL license; and disclosure of modifications to the library.

Code Contributions
If you want to contribute to animationEngines codebase and want your changes to be accepted into the main trunc,

Finally, thank you for helping out! If you purchased a license for animationEngine, I really appreciate that! It helps moving the library forward! If you are using animationEngine in a GPL context and still want to help, I would really appreciate a donation via PAYPAL to info@derbrill.de
