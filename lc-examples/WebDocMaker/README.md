# WebDocMaker

## LiveCode Documentation/Guide Generator

This is a simple tool that will extract the LiveCode dictionary and guide
data from the current LiveCode installation and build a directory of
stand alone files that can be used to browse the data without having
LiveCode running.  This could be used to make the data available to
another device.  All that is required is a web browser.  The CSS does not
currently work well on a mobile phone, but a landscape tablet does work.

The dictionary is located at `api.html` and the guides are located at
`guide.html` along side the stack.
